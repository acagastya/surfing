# Web surfing

## About this page

Over the years, I have learned a great deal of things from Dr John N Shutt. One of the things that Dr Shutt would mention was their surfing page.

I was careless to lose that message. Ironically, in that message, Dr Shutt had explained how he would save a list of all the resources that he had found helpful over the years. While that message is lost, the intent is passed on successfully. This is my page of the resources.
